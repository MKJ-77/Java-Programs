# ☕ Java Practice Programs Repository

Welcome to the **Java Practice Programs Repository**!  
This repository contains a well-organized collection of Java programs covering fundamental to intermediate concepts in Java programming that I learned at my School. It's perfect for students, beginners, and anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills in Java.
I have started my DSA journey at my college 1st Year.
